# 🚀 Next Steps - Recipe App Development

## **Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-01-15)**

### **✅ Recently Completed**
- **GitHub Pages 404 Error Resolution**: Successfully fixed persistent 404 errors on `https://winningfungus48.github.io/recipes/`
  - Updated Vite config: `base: '/recipes/'`
  - Updated Router: `basename="/recipes"`
  - Added `.nojekyll` file to repo root
  - Created SPA fallback `404.html`
  - Clean build and deployment of exact `dist/` contents
  - All assets now load correctly with proper `/recipes/assets/...` paths

### **🔄 Current Issue**
- **Sample Recipe Data Missing**: The 10 sample recipes that were previously added are not persisting on the deployed site
- Need to implement effective sample data management for testing and development

---

## **📋 Pending Requirements & Questions**

### **Immediate Sample Data (Phase 1)**
1. **Sample Recipe Source**: Where are the 10 sample recipes currently stored? 
   - CSV file, JSON file, or hardcoded in the app?

2. **Data Persistence**: Should the sample recipes be:
   - Automatically loaded on first visit (one-time initialization)?
   - Available as a "Load Sample Data" button for testing?
   - Both options available?

3. **Sample Data Scope**: Should the sample recipes include:
   - Just basic recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions)?
   - Full metadata (ratings, categories, tags, images)?
   - A mix of different recipe types to test all features?

### **Future Data Architecture (Phase 2+)**
4. **User Accounts**: When you mention "accounts in the future," do you envision:
   - Local user accounts (stored in browser)?
   - Cloud-based accounts with backend authentication?
   - Hybrid approach (local first, cloud sync later)?

5. **Recipe Bank**: For the "bank of recipes" that users can add to their collection:
   - Should this be a curated set of recipes you provide?
   - Community-contributed recipes?
   - Imported from external sources (websites, APIs)?

6. **Data Migration**: When transitioning from local storage to user accounts:
   - Should existing local data be preserved and migrated?
   - Should users be able to export/import their data?

### **Testing & Development**
7. **Testing Strategy**: For testing features on the deployed site:
   - Should sample data be easily reset/cleared for fresh testing?
   - Should there be different sample datasets for different testing scenarios?
   - Should there be a "developer mode" with additional testing tools?

8. **Data Management**: Should there be:
   - A "Manage Data" page for clearing/resetting sample data?
   - Bulk import/export functionality for testing?
   - Data validation and error handling for sample data?

## **🎯 Priority Focus Areas**

### **Main Priorities (Immediate)**
1. **Sample Data Implementation**: Get sample recipes working on deployed site
2. **Testing Capability**: Enable effective feature testing on live site
3. **Data Management**: Create tools for managing sample/test data

### **Future Considerations**
1. **User Account Foundation**: Design data architecture for future user accounts
2. **Recipe Bank System**: Plan for curated recipe collections
3. **Data Migration Strategy**: Plan for transitioning from local to cloud storage
