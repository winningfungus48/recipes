# üöÄ Next Steps - Recipe App Development
first do the hamburger menu improvement then do the add new recipe dropdown afterwards. 

## **üéØ Next Improvement: Hamburger Menu (Navigation Drawer)**

### **Cursor Prompt ‚Äì Hamburger Menu (Navigation Drawer)**

Act as a senior SaaS engineer. Implement a functional hamburger menu for the Recipe App. When the hamburger icon is clicked, a **slide-in side drawer** should appear from the left with a semi-transparent overlay that closes the drawer when clicked or when the user presses escape.

Inside the drawer, add navigation links for both existing and placeholder pages:

* **Home** (future landing page)
* **Recipes** (existing `/recipes` page)
* **Favorites** (placeholder `/favorites` page)
* **Categories** (placeholder `/categories` page with filter functionality later)
* **About** (placeholder `/about` page)
* **Settings/Contact** (placeholder `/settings` page)

Use the app's existing icon set to add simple icons next to each link for polish. Keep placeholder pages minimal ‚Äî just scaffold routes with a header/title for now. Ensure the drawer is reusable and easily expandable as more pages are added.

Deliverable should include:

* Updated hamburger icon click behavior to open/close the drawer
* Slide-in animation and overlay
* Navigation links wired to routes (existing and placeholder)
* Minimal placeholder pages scaffolded for each new route
* A short markdown summary listing updated/added files, routes created, and verification steps

Do not modify unrelated components or styling beyond the scope of this navigation drawer.


**Cursor Prompt ‚Äî Add New Recipe Dropdown (Desktop + Mobile)**

Act as a senior SaaS engineer. Replace the existing **Import button** in the top navigation with a new **‚ÄúAdd New Recipe‚Äù dropdown** that works consistently on both desktop and mobile.

### Requirements

1. **Dropdown Options**

   * **Single Recipe (Manual Entry)** ‚Üí route to manual entry page.
   * **Import by URL** ‚Üí route to existing import page.
   * **Bulk Import** ‚Üí route to existing bulk import page.
   * **Screenshots** ‚Üí create new `/screenshots` page with placeholder text (‚ÄúComing Soon: Screenshot Import‚Äù), simple layout, no functionality.

2. **Desktop Behavior**

   * Dropdown button placed in the top nav where Import button was.
   * Opens on **hover**, closes automatically on selection.
   * Text-only links, consistent styling with current nav.
   * Smooth fade/slide animation for open/close.

3. **Mobile Behavior**

   * Inside the hamburger drawer, show **‚ÄúAdd New Recipe‚Äù** as an expandable submenu.
   * Expands/collapses on **tap**; closes after selection.
   * Uses the same shared dropdown component as desktop for consistency.

4. **Reusability & Accessibility**

   * Build the dropdown as a reusable component so new options (e.g., AI Import, Camera Capture) can be added easily.
   * Ensure **keyboard navigation support**: tab/arrow keys move through items.
   * Highlight active/selected item with subtle background or underline.

5. **Styling Enhancements**

   * Style ‚ÄúAdd New Recipe‚Äù button slightly more prominently (primary action style).
   * Preserve consistent spacing and alignment across breakpoints.

### Deliverables

* New reusable **AddNewRecipeDropdown** component in `src/components/`.
* Updated nav bar (desktop) and hamburger drawer (mobile) to use this dropdown.
* New `/screenshots` placeholder page scaffolded with template.
* Short markdown summary listing updated files, new component, and verification steps (desktop hover works, mobile expand works, routes navigate correctly, accessibility confirmed).

Do not modify unrelated components. Keep all other pages functional.

## **Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-01-15)**

### **‚úÖ Recently Completed**
- **GitHub Pages 404 Error Resolution**: Successfully fixed persistent 404 errors on `https://winningfungus48.github.io/recipes/`
  - Updated Vite config: `base: '/recipes/'`
  - Updated Router: `basename="/recipes"`
  - Added `.nojekyll` file to repo root
  - Created SPA fallback `404.html`
  - Clean build and deployment of exact `dist/` contents
  - All assets now load correctly with proper `/recipes/assets/...` paths

### **üîÑ Current Issue**
- **Sample Recipe Data Missing**: The 10 sample recipes that were previously added are not persisting on the deployed site
- Need to implement effective sample data management for testing and development

---

## **üìã Pending Requirements & Questions**

### **Immediate Sample Data (Phase 1)**
1. **Sample Recipe Source**: Where are the 10 sample recipes currently stored? 
   - CSV file, JSON file, or hardcoded in the app?

2. **Data Persistence**: Should the sample recipes be:
   - Automatically loaded on first visit (one-time initialization)?
   - Available as a "Load Sample Data" button for testing?
   - Both options available?

3. **Sample Data Scope**: Should the sample recipes include:
   - Just basic recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions)?
   - Full metadata (ratings, categories, tags, images)?
   - A mix of different recipe types to test all features?

### **Future Data Architecture (Phase 2+)**
4. **User Accounts**: When you mention "accounts in the future," do you envision:
   - Local user accounts (stored in browser)?
   - Cloud-based accounts with backend authentication?
   - Hybrid approach (local first, cloud sync later)?

5. **Recipe Bank**: For the "bank of recipes" that users can add to their collection:
   - Should this be a curated set of recipes you provide?
   - Community-contributed recipes?
   - Imported from external sources (websites, APIs)?

6. **Data Migration**: When transitioning from local storage to user accounts:
   - Should existing local data be preserved and migrated?
   - Should users be able to export/import their data?

### **Testing & Development**
7. **Testing Strategy**: For testing features on the deployed site:
   - Should sample data be easily reset/cleared for fresh testing?
   - Should there be different sample datasets for different testing scenarios?
   - Should there be a "developer mode" with additional testing tools?

8. **Data Management**: Should there be:
   - A "Manage Data" page for clearing/resetting sample data?
   - Bulk import/export functionality for testing?
   - Data validation and error handling for sample data?
