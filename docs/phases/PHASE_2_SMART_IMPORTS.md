## üîí **Next Steps: Security & Privacy Implementation**

### **Critical Security Requirements**

The current application has several security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment:

#### **High Priority Security Issues**
- [ ] **Input Validation & Sanitization** - No protection against XSS or malicious input
- [ ] **Data Encryption** - All data stored in plain text in localStorage
- [ ] **Authentication System** - No user authentication or access controls
- [ ] **Security Headers** - Missing CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers
- [ ] **URL Security** - Insecure URL handling and web scraping functionality
- [ ] **Data Privacy** - No privacy controls or data protection measures

#### **Security Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - [ ] Sanitize all user inputs before processing
  - [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
  - [ ] Escape HTML/JavaScript in user content
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for form submissions

- [ ] **Data Protection & Encryption**
  - [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption for recipe data
  - [ ] Add secure key management
  - [ ] Implement data integrity verification
  - [ ] Consider IndexedDB with encryption

- [ ] **Authentication & Access Control**
  - [ ] Implement secure login/logout system

  - [ ] Add CORS protection
  - [ ] Implement secure web scraping with backend proxy
  - [ ] Add request validation and rate limiting

- [ ] **Client-Side Security**
  - [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] Add X-Frame-Options protection
  - [ ] Implement secure error handling
  - [ ] Add client-side data masking

- [ ] **Privacy Protection**
  - [ ] Implement data anonymization options
  - [ ] Add user consent management
  - [ ] Implement data retention policies
  - [ ] Add GDPR compliance features

- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**
  - [ ] Implement security event logging
  - [ ] Add intrusion detection
  - [ ] Implement audit trail for data changes
  - [ ] Add security incident reporting

## üîÑ **Phase Transition**

Phase 2 is **functionally complete** but requires security implementation before production deployment. The app provides professional-grade recipe management with advanced import capabilities, comprehensive filtering, and enhanced user experience.

**Next Priority**: Security & Privacy Implementation  
**Then Ready for Phase 3**: AI Assistant Foundation
