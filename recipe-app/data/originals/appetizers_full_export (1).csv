Bread,Appetizers & Sides,,,"1 1/2 cups warm water (about 100 degrees F) (360mL)
1 packet yeast (active dry, instant, or quick rise- 2.25 teaspoons)
1/2 tablespoon fine grain salt (preferably NOT iodized, see notes)
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour (430g)
1 tsp sugar if using active dry yeast","Instant Yeast: Just mix water, yeast and salt together until fully dissolved
Active Dry Yeast: Proof it by mixing it with ¼ cup water and 1 tsp sugar. Let it sit for 10 min and foam
Add flour to the bowl and stir together until a sticky dough forms. Don't worry about mixing it too much, just make sure everything is uniformly wet. It WILL be messy and sticky. You can scrape what's left on the spoon with a silicone spatula.
Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and leave it for 2-3 hours to rise in a somewhat warm place.
30 minutes - 1 hr before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and place your Dutch oven in the oven, with the lid ON
Once the oven reaches 450, keep it preheating for another 20 minutes
Scrape the dough into the edge of a piece of parchment paper dusted with flour. Make it into as much of a ""loaf"" shape as you can by folding the edges up on top of it (a silicone spatula works well for this).
Then, use the edges of the parchment paper to flip the loaf over so the floured side is on top and the loaf is in the center of the parchment paper. Don't worry about it looking beautiful or smooth on top.
Take out the preheated Dutch oven and take off the lid, carefully! Grab the parchment from the sides and place the loaf in your Dutch oven.
Place the cover back on the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven on the center rack.
Bake for 35 minutes at 450 degrees F (40 minutes if dough was cold from the fridge).
Remove lid and bake for another 5-10 minutes
Remove the loaf from the dutch oven and let it cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing"," Rosemary + Olive Oil: 2 tbsp of both, just mix it in but you might need more flour To see if dough is kneaded enough, take a little part and stretch it. If it doesn’t break, you’re good. If it does, keep kneading. If it’s too sticky and you think you’ve added enough flour, let it sit for 5 minutes Rub olive oil in the bowl before putting the dough in to rise Cinnamon Raisin: 1 tsp cinnamon, ¼ cup raisins Honey: ¼ cup, maybe less idk",

Black truffle salt and freshly ground black pepper","Preheat oven to 200 ̊F and place a rack in the center. Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and place next to the stovetop.
1. To prepare the potatoes: Soak cut potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes. To an electric deep fryer or large Dutch oven set over medium heat, add oil. Heat oil to 330°F.
2. To prepare the aioli: To a medium mixing bowl add egg yolk, garlic, and water; whisk together. To a small liquid measuring cup add olive oil and vegetable oil; whisk to combine. While whisking the egg mixture vigorously, add oil in drops to form an emulsion. Continue whisking and slowly drizzling in the oil to form a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning with lemon juice, black truffle salt, and pepper. Cover and keep refrigerated until ready to use.
3. To fry the potatoes: Drain potatoes and dry very thoroughly with paper towels. Working in batches, blanch potatoes in hot oil until nearly cooked through but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes, adjusting the heat of the stove to maintain oil temperature close to 330°F. Remove blanched potatoes from oil with a slotted spoon or spider and place on the cooling rack. Repeat process with the remaining potatoes.
