Cut the chicken breasts in half and pound to even thickness: Cut through the middle of the chicken breast as if you are going to butterfly it (cutting it open like a book), but cut all the way through to make two equal sized pieces.
After cutting the chicken breasts in half, place them in a gallon sized zip top bag in an even layer, seal it, then pound them to an even thickness using a  meat pounder or a rolling pin. You can also place the chicken breasts between two layers of cling wrap instead of a zip top bag if you prefer.
Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel, then season with salt and pepper.
In one shallow dish, mix together panko bread crumbs, grated parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and black pepper.
In another shallow dish, whisk one egg.
Dip one chicken breast into the egg, then into the bread crumb mixture.  Ensure chicken breast is fully coated in the crumb mixture, and gently press with your hand do help the crumbs stick to the chicken.  Place chicken breast on prepared baking sheet, repeat with remaining pieces of chicken.
Place baking sheet in oven on the second from the top rack.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.
Flip chicken, pour 1/4 cup of marinara sauce over each piece of chicken, then top with cheese. Place back in the oven. Turn on the broiler. Broil for 2-4 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly and edges of chicken are browning.",,
Pan Roasted Bavette with Pan Jus,Meals - Lunch/Dinner,,,"1 1/2 pounds bavette or flank steak
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme, plus 3 sprigs
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
2 large shallots, minced
1 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth","1. Allow steak to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. To prepare the steak: To a large skillet set over medium-high heat, add oil. While the skillet is heating, season the steak generously with salt, pepper, and minced thyme. When oil is shimmering, carefully place steak into the skillet and sear until
browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven. Remove the steaks when medium-rare (125° to 130°F on instant-read thermometer).
3. Transfer steak to a cutting board with a well and loosely tent with foil to keep warm.
4. To prepare the sauce: Return skillet to stove over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons butter. When butter is melted and foam subsides, add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 3 minutes. If shallots become dry during cooking, add water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the wine and broth, using the spoon to loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the thyme sprigs and increase heat to medium-high, bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and continue to simmer until the sauce is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and remove the thyme sprigs, whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
6. To serve: Cut steak against the grain into slices, transfer to warmed dinner plates, place a spoonful of red wine sauce atop of the steak, and serve immediately."," The goal of a pan sauce is to capture the savory cooked-on juices left in the pan, which you do by deglazing, or dissolving with a liquid. Once you have mastered this technique, you will have fun improvising with various ingredients and flavorings. Sur la Table Recipe",

1 ½ cups heavy or thickened cream (or evaporated milk for lower calorie/fat)

½ cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese","Season chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and onion powder.
