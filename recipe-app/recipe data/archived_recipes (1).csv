Melt the 2 tablespoons butter in 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add chicken and cook for 4-5 (depending on thickness) per side until golden and cooked through. Transfer chicken to a plate, don't wipe out skillet.
Mix chicken broth with cornstarch and add to the skillet, followed by all of the sauce ingredients, including the 1 tablespoon reserved flour mixture.

Taste the sauce and add additional lemon juice for tangier/less sweet if desired.
Add chicken back to the skillet and spoon some of the sauce over top. Warm through over low heat so the chicken can soak up some of the sauce.

Chicken Birria Tacos,Archived,,,"For the Sauce:
3-4 dried chipotle or ancho chillies, if you can’t find these then use 3-4 red chillies but we definitely recommend dried chillies or some type! We also used these Chipotle and Ancho because they are the easiest to find in UK supermarkets.
500ml of chicken stock.
Tin of chopped tomatoes.
Tsp of cumin
Tsp of smoked paprika.
Tbsp of oregano.

8 mini corn or flour tortillas.

1 onion - diced.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a deep pan, season chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper and add to pan. Cook for 3-4 mins on each side before removing, don’t worry, they don’t need to be fully cooked at this point, we just want some colour on them.
Whilst chicken thighs are cooking, to your blender add chopped tomatoes, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, salt and pepper (to taste) and blitz until smooth.
Back to the pan. Once chicken thighs are removed, deglaze pan with apple cider vinegar and onion. Cook onion for 5 mins until soft, then add garlic and cook for 1-2 mins. Add blended sauce to pan, stir well and then add chicken thighs back to pan along with cinnamon stick. Cover and leave to simmer on low heat for at least 30 mins.

Once cooked, your sauce should be thick and your chicken thighs should fall apart easily. Remove them and shred into fine pieces. Remove a few ladles of sauce from pan and set aside, this will be used as a dip for your tacos. Make sure you leave some sauce in pan to dip tortilla before building quesa-tacos.
Time to build your quesa-tacos (quesadilla tacos!). Add a small amount of oil to a non-stick pan, coat your tortilla in sauce remaining in pan used to simmer, then add tortilla to oiled pan.
